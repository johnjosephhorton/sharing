%Some goods are easy to make a consumption plan for---rental homes, high-end camera equipment. 
% While it makes sense to think of consumers making an extensive margin decision---buy or not buy---their individual decision, at least for some goods, is based on a solution to another optimization problem. 
% When considering a purchase, individuals are deciding ``how much am I going to use this?'' 
% This decision has to be made for nearly every consequential purchase. 
% Once a durable good is purchased, the cost of using---less depreciation---is the opportunity cost of doing something else. 
% Once purchased, a good is used up until the point that its declining marginal utility equals only the opportunity cost. 
% This is a different decision than one makes if using a rental, where the marginal cost is both the opportunity cost and the rental rate.

% When the capital costs are very high but usage by owners is relatively low, it is more likely that there are large numbers of would-be consumers and the excess capacity to satisfy them.  
% Goods being offered my a monopolist are likely to be below the  
% Most people spent only about two minutes a day brushing their teeth, giving them 4,598 minutes they could rent out their toothbrush.  
% But reset costs are likely to be high, people want to brush around the same times each day and the price of a toothbrush is so low that anyone who brushes their teeth finds it more convenient to own. 

% % Idea: time use survey 
% Owning a good and renting it out generates costs. 
% Some of these are recognizable transaction costs, such as finding a renter and coming to terms. 
% There is also the cost of writing contracts and monitoring compliance, purchasing insurance, dealing with moral hazard and adverse selection.\footnote{High-end car company had its entire fleet of fancy cars stolen.} 

% The main effect of IT when paired with for-profit platforms are reductions in the costs of renting. 
% The platforms aggregate demand and expose where supply resides, reducing search costs. 
% They have standardize contracts. 
% They measure usage and handle payments. 
% They invest in tools to reduce information asymmetries and moral hazard. 

% % How much time was spent with a good  
% % How much that good or service costs

% What IT enables: 
% - aggregate demand 
% - expose where the supply resides 
% - overcome informational problems (information asymmetries and moral
% hazard) 
% - payment timing issues (the escrow problem) 
% - Adding complexity of moral hazard. 

% Similar to P2P electronic commerce in many respects.  Uber and Airbnb are the most prominent examples. 
% The sharing economy raises several economic questions whose answer is not intuitively obvious. 
% On the one hand, if individuals can rent infrequently used property to each other, then it seems plausible that fewer of those things are actually needed. 
% For example, it is easy to imagine one suburban neighborhood sharing a single drill, whereas before, multiple households would have purchased one. 
% Of course, rental markets are not new. 
 % On the other hand, when individuals can share durable goods among themselves the greater intensity of use may actually increase demand: 
% this ``rebound effect'' or Jevons paradox seems possible. 
% Another question is who participates in the sharing economy: 
% heavy users of some durable good are likely to purchase rather than rent, but they are also unlikely to rent the item out as they are unlikely to have much spare capacity to rent. 
% Light users do have more capacity, but they are potentially the ones that get the least utility from the good anyway. 


% \subsection{Distributional impacts of the P2P rental market} 
% For a renter, indirect utility under the short-run P2P rental equilibrium is
% \begin{eqnarray} 
% v_L(\alpha_L, r) &=& \frac{1}{4}\left(r - 2\alpha_L \right)^2  \notag \\
%                  &=& \frac{1}{4} \left[ (1-\alpha_H) + \alpha_L \right]^2
% \end{eqnarray} 
% which is always positive. 
% Note further that the renter's increase in utility from the P2P-rental market is proportional to the square of their own (hypothetical) consumption and the high-types \emph{non}-consumption in the absence of the rental market. 
% In other words, for renters, the most value is unlocked when they had high latent demand unmet demand for the good and when there was a great deal of ``wasted'' excess capacity from the high-types. 

% For the owner of a good, their pre-rental market indirect utility was $\alpha_H^2$. 
% The increase in utility from the emergence of the P2P rental market, $\Delta v_O = v_O(\alpha_H, r) - \alpha_H^2$ is  
% \begin{eqnarray} 
% \Delta v_H &=& \left( \frac{3}{4} (1-\alpha_H) + \frac{1}{4} \alpha_L \right) (-1 + \alpha_H + \alpha_L) \notag  \\
%                  &=& \left( \frac{3}{4} (1-\alpha_H) + \frac{1}{4} \alpha_L \right) r  \notag  \\
%                  &>& (1-\alpha_H)r 
% \end{eqnarray} 
% As we would expect, any increase in utility depends upon having a positive rental rate. 
% We also know that this is only the case if $1- \alpha_H < \alpha_L$ and so $\Delta v_O > (1-\alpha_H)r$. 
% In other words, the increase in utility for the owner is always greater than simply selling the $1-\alpha_H$ at $r$. 
% The economic intuition is that when there is an excess of demand, the owner can optimally economize their own consumption to increase their utility beyond just not adjusting own-consumption and selling the excess.  

% \begin{prop}
% An increase in $\alpha_L$ increases the owner's surplus from the emergence the P2P rental market. 
% \end{prop} 
% \begin{proof}
% Unsurprisingly, an increase in $\alpha_L$ simply increases demand for the owner's excess capacity and so the increase in utility is proportional to the owner's capacity, $1-\alpha_H$ and the latent demand from the low-type, $\alpha_L$.  
% \begin{align}
% \frac{\partial \Delta v_O}{\partial \alpha_L} = \frac{1}{2} \left[(1-\alpha_H) + \alpha_L \right] > 0.  
% \end{align} 
% \end{proof} 

% \begin{prop}
% An owner's utility is increasing in the $\alpha$ and increasing in the rental rate, $r$. 
% \end{prop}

% \begin{prop}
% Regardless of the rental rate, an owner has a higher utility with the existent of the P2P rental market assuming there is no change in the product market price for the good. 
% \end{prop}

% “We’re going to have to invent new economics to capture the impact of the sharing economy,” says Arun Sundararajan, a professor at the Stern School of Business at NYU who studies this phenomenon. The largest question for academics is whether this all creates new value or just replaces existing businesses.

% - Need to prove the uniqueness of equilibria 
% - How does depreciaation enter in? it's now a fixed cost for renters 
% - In the long-run, for the same market price p, the product market demand is less elastic because the marginal buyer can not receive rental income, which rises with the product market price. It's not completely offsetting, 
% - If product market demand less elastic, if the products have market power product market prices should rise.  
% - To owners to fully internalize benefits?

% Peer-to-peer rental markets 
% Recently a number of computer-mediated peer-to-peer (P2P) rental markets in durable consumer goods have emerged. 
% In this paper, I present a simple model where consumers that differ in their planned usage (and hence ownership decision) about goods creates the potential for P2P trades. 
% I compare a short-run where existing owners can rent to non-owners and a long-run where all consumers can revise their ownership decisions. 
% The model makes several predictions. 
% First, to support a P2P rental market, product market prices have to be low enough that some people buy, but not so low that everyone buys: 
% the existence of non-owners that still value that good is what generates the demand. 
% Market clearing in the short-run comes from owners and renters economizing on use---though a glut is possible if spare owner capacity exceeds non-owner demand even when the rental rate is zero. 
% Market clearing in the long-run comes as consumers revise their initial ownership decisions in light of the possibility of sharing.  
% In long-run, consumers are indifferent between renting and owning---they consume the same amount of the good at the same cost. 
% Most commentators have implicitly assumed that P2P rental markets will reduce total ownership, but a sharing economy ``Jevon's paradox'' is possible in which the emergence of P2P rentals stimulate greater ownership---namely if the short-run rental rate is greater than the product market price, consumers will be drawn into ownership.   
% I also consider the comparative statics from technological innovations that reduce transaction costs and explore what goods are particularly amenable to rental.

% \subsection{Lending} 
% Even in the absence of P2P rental markets, individuals can still lend goods to each other. 
% Figure~\ref{fig:lending} shows the fraction of owners reporting having lent an item to someone else.  

% Goods that had the highest fraction of individuals reporting renting are not frequently lent out. 
% This is not surprising, as they are not widely owned: 
% no one lends out bouncy castles, jet skis, canoes, vacation homes etc. because almost no one in the sampled owns them. 
% Further, goods that are nearly universally owned in the sample are not very likely to be lent out: 
% for example, blenders are infrequently lent out despite being owned by all respondents---but there presumably is not much demand since this ``owned by everyone'' is generally true in the population. 
% The ``sweet spot'' for lending appears to be goods with ``middle'' rates of ownership:
