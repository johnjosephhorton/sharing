Hi John,

In a bout of procrastination, I read your paper. I like the paper. It is a simple explanation of how the decreased costs of renting affect market structure. I also like the survey, which is a nice touch. 
 
Comments (I did not note minor grammar mistakes because this is an old version):

I think the intro is not focused and has too many asides. You need to have a main research question, explain your approach, and give the results in a concise manner. To me these are: 
 - Diff btwn long-run and short-run prices/quantities.
 - Possibility that overall demand for good increases or decreases w/ decrease in transaction costs. I think this is a non-obvious point for many people. (Demand can decrease if there is depreciation, and actually there might be a nice dynamic version of this model in that case)
 - You confirmed utility specification in data and you show the importance of predictability of usage. 
  
Suggested additions / things to think about:
1) Where is the supply side for the good. Who produces homes in your model and what is the cost of producing a home? 
2) Explicit model of unpredictability. It would be nice if you tied unpredictability into the utility specification. For example, the cost of renting may be higher if rental is on short notice.
3) Another justification for rental is that people may have diverse preferences. One day they may like a Ferrari and another day an SUV. Cheaper rental allows for this. You might discuss how this fits into your model.
4) Relationship with income. Rich people may value consumption more, but they also consume different types of goods (in terms of quality). Furthermore, their cost of rental may be higher because they have a higher shadow value of time. It would be cool to parametrize the conditions under which a decrease in rental costs increases the share of rich vs poor ownership. (I know that in your model both low and high types have the same tradeoff when choosing to rent or buy). 
5) You make a claim that "If the market-clearing short-run rate is above the purchase price, then ownership will increase in the long-run". This should be a testable implication of your model. 
6) What is the empirical analogue of the alpha term? How might we recover it?
7) One interesting source of variation may be city densities. More dense places may support rental markets w/ lower transaction costs. Of course, more dense places have a higher cost of ownership because space is expensive. 
8) I would reword your predictability question to say something like:
What is the likelihood that you know you will use the good at a particular time 1 day (1 week) before using it.
