% Peer-to-peer rental markets 
% Recently a number of computer-mediated peer-to-peer (P2P) rental markets in durable consumer goods have emerged. 
% In this paper, I present a simple model where consumers that differ in their planned usage (and hence ownership decision) about goods creates the potential for P2P trades. 
% I compare a short-run where existing owners can rent to non-owners and a long-run where all consumers can revise their ownership decisions. 
% The model makes several predictions. 
% First, to support a P2P rental market, product market prices have to be low enough that some people buy, but not so low that everyone buys: 
% the existence of non-owners that still value that good is what generates the demand. 
% Market clearing in the short-run comes from owners and renters economizing on use---though a glut is possible if spare owner capacity exceeds non-owner demand even when the rental rate is zero. 
% Market clearing in the long-run comes as consumers revise their initial ownership decisions in light of the possibility of sharing.  
% In long-run, consumers are indifferent between renting and owning---they consume the same amount of the good at the same cost. 
% Most commentators have implicitly assumed that P2P rental markets will reduce total ownership, but a sharing economy ``Jevon's paradox'' is possible in which the emergence of P2P rentals stimulate greater ownership---namely if the short-run rental rate is greater than the product market price, consumers will be drawn into ownership.   
% I also consider the comparative statics from technological innovations that reduce transaction costs and explore what goods are particularly amenable to rental.

\section{Introduction}
Peer-to-peer (P2P) rental markets have recently sprung up for a variety of durable goods:
examples include cars, lodging, clothing, tools, bicycles, cameras, offices, parking spaces and so on.
These new marketplaces are invariably computer-mediated, with the facilitating platform taking steps to reduce the transactions costs that presumably made these kinds of exchanges unprofitable to run in the past. 
There is a large number of ``sharing economy'' platform businesses that are customized for the P2P rental of houses, cars, boats, bicycles, tools, cameras, parking spaces, offices, clothes and so on. 
Perhaps the most prominent example of P2P rental markets is Airbnb, which allows individuals to rent out spare bedrooms, apartments or even entire homes. 

These so-called ``sharing economy'' platforms have been heralded by many: 
they promise to expand access to goods, diversify individual consumption, increase efficiency by increasing asset utiliziation and provide more ways for individuals to earn income.
They might also reduce ownership and therefore offer environmental benefits.  
Aside from the business interest in these platforms---Airbnb alone has attracted nearly \$800 million in venture capital investment\footnote{\href{http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb}{http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/airbnb}}---these companies have also attracted policy interest---much of it negative. 
Critics charge that their primary competitive advantage of these platforms is the ability to duck costly regulations---regulations that often are intended to keep costs from being imposed on third-parties.\footnote{See \cite{horton2014tragedy} for a discussion of the externalities imposed by Airbnb-style subletting is rented apartments.}   

The somewhat obvious economic rationale for P2P rental markets is that most durable goods are used by their owners far less than 100\% of the time: the excess capacity this under-utilization generates can be ``shared'' (i.e., rented to) non-owners that still value the good but whose planned usage (or income, storage space, credit rating etc.) prevents them from owning the good. 
These kinds of trades between consumers have always been possible, but they often have substantial transaction costs.
It is perhaps for this reason that much of the sharing of consumer goods historically has been between family members and neighbors rather than strangers. 
The emergence of platform-mediated reputation systems and other trust-building socio-economic technologies (plus in many cases, platform-provided insurance) presumably allow the platforms to reduce the otherwise market-preventing transaction costs inherent in P2P rental. 

Despite the simple economic story of increased utilization, it raises several questions:
what explains the initial distribution of ownership and non-ownership before the P2P rental market emerges?
When it does emerge, what determines the rental rate and size of the market? 
How much consumer surplus is unlocked and how is it distributed? 
How does the short-run rental rate---where existing owners rent to non-owners---differ from the long-run in which owners and non-owners alike can revise their ownership decision in light of the existence of a P2P rental market?  
What is effect of total product market demand---both in terms of market-clearing and elasticity?  
Can non-consuming firm owners compete in the P2P rental market? 
What goods are particularly amenable to sharing and why?
  
This paper addresses these questions using a simple consumer-theory type model augmented with a survey of consumers about their ownership decisions about various goods and their hypothetical (or actual) usage of such goods. 
In the model, all consumers consider purchasing some durable good before the possibility of rental.   
The would-be owner's utility depends on how much the good would be ``used'' if purchased.
I assume that goods offer declining---and eventually negative---marginal utility from use.\footnote{Even in the absence of any direct marginal usage cost, individuals will generally not use a good 100\% of the time. 
For example, a hobbyist guitar owner might play 5 hours a week, but few would play 50 voluntarily and 100 hours a week would hellish for nearly everyone.} 
If the utility from the optimal level of usage is greater than the purchase price, the consumer buys the good. 

With two consumers ``types'' three possible market configurations are possible: 
everyone buys the good, no one buys the good and high types but not low types buy the good.  
While P2P rental markets can cause all market configurations to change, I start with the ``only high-types buy'' configuration. 
I assume that a technological shock creates a P2P rental market that owners did not foresee. 
This creates a ``short-run'' P2P rental market in which equilibrium is defined by a rental rate that clears the market among existing owners and non-owners. 
The rental rate is increasing in the valuation of the high-types (which reduces supply) and the valuation of the low-types (which increases demand). 
Interestingly, with the P2P rental market, both owners and non-owners use the good as if they were renting the good at the market-clearing rental rate. 
For renters the reason is that they do face that rental rate; 
for owners, they now face a marginal opportunity cost of usage, which is also the rental rate. 
The short-run market does not necessarily clear: if pre-P2P rental excess capacity exceeds demand, there is a glut. 
In practice, the inherent transaction cost of bringing excess capacity to the market would provide a price floor.     
I consider effect of transaction costs on the rental market by modifying the model as well as explore how the transaction costs of renting various goods differs though my survey of consumers. 

In addition to the short-run, I consider a long-run where owners and renters alike can revise their purchase decisions. 
If the short-run rental rate is below the purchase price plus the costs of renting, then ownership is less attractive, which will reduce \emph{purchase} demand for product, lowering prices. 
However, if the rental rate is above the purchase price plus the cost of renting, ownership becomes more attractive, increasing demand and raising purchase prices in the product market. 
In the long-run, the purchase price must equal the rental rate.  

In the long-run P2P rental market, both high- and low-types receive the same utility from owning or renting, decoupling individual preference from ownership. 
In practice, consumer risk-aversion would likely still cause higher-value consumers to be the owners, since a fall-off in market demand can be better absorbed by them though own-consumption. 
The revision in the ownership decision in the long-run potentially affects product market demand. 

I show that the existence of a P2P rental market allows for a higher maximum price in a market. 
In other words, the existence of a P2P rental market can generate positive demand for a good at a price at which no consumer would be willing to buy in the absence of the P2P rental market. 
On the downside for producers, product markets with an ``everyone buys'' characterization but for which P2P renting is possible, demand could contact.   

The survey was designed to assess the basic assumptions and predictions of the model.
Consumers were asked a series of questions about a single good (e.g., a BBQ grill) such as whether they own one, whether they have lent it out or borrowed it and, regardless of whether they own it, how much they would use it. 
If they did not own it, they were asked why. 
I also asked questions about how the good in question is characteristically used: it is used in long, predictable blocks of time, or in small, granular chunks that arise unpredictably. 
Finally, the respondent was asked for their household income.  
Self-reported income affects the purchase decision, but so does planned usage. 
For only a small number of goods (e.g., vacation homes) does income seem to be the limiting factor. 
For other goods, planned usage was primary.  

To keep the analysis simple, I initially ignore transaction costs, reset costs and depreciation. 
I modify the basic framework to include these costs and consider how it changes the results. 
One of the main findings is that when transactions costs are sufficiently high, the P2P rental market cannot exist. 
This finding suggests that the technological changes---namely the maturation and increasing penetration of the Internet and web-based technologies---were the technological shock that made these P2P rental markets feasible. 

\section{Consumer's decision about how intensively to use a good} 
Consider a consumer that has to decide how much of their time to allocate to the use of some purchased durable good. 
Their money-denominated utility function is
\begin{align}
u(x) = 2 \alpha x - x^2  
\end{align} 
where $x \in [0,1]$ is the fraction of time they spend using the good and $\alpha \in (0,1)$ parameterizes their valuation of the good. 
Note that in contrast to a conventional utility function from consumer theory, marginal utility can be negative:
since the consumer is using time for use a good, usage precludes the usage of other goods whose value from usage is (eventually) higher. 
Individual intensive margin demand is  
\begin{align}
x^* = \alpha  
\end{align} 
and indirect utility is 
\begin{align}
v(\alpha) = u(x^*) = \alpha^2.  
\end{align} 
The good costs $p$ to own, and so a forward-looking consumer will buy if 
\begin{align} 
\alpha^2 > p. 
\end{align} 
Note that for all $\alpha^2 > p1$, the consumer will have an amount of time $1 - x^*$ when they are not using the good.
Figure~\ref{fig:consumer} illustrates the consumer problem by showing the utility from various levels of usage depending on $\alpha$.
The usage solution for each consumer is their $\alpha$ parameter and since indirect utility is just $\alpha^2$, the optimal usage for each value falls along the curve traced out by $x^2$.
The purchase price $p$ determines who buys the good, with all those having $\alpha^2 > p$ deciding to own and those below choosing not to purchase the good.

\subsection{Three consumption possibilities with two consumer types} 
Consider a marketplace with two consumer types that are equally common: $\alpha_H$ and $\alpha_L$ with $\alpha_H > \alpha_L$. 
For a given price $p$, there are three market possibilities: 
when $\alpha_L^2 > p$ everyone buys the good; when $\alpha_H^2 > p > \alpha_L^2$, high-types buy the good but low-types do not; when $\alpha_H^2 < p$  no one buys the good. This gives a market demand curve of 
\begin{align}
   D(p) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{ll}
       0 & : p > \alpha_H^2\\
       1 & : \alpha_H^2 \ge p > \alpha_L^2  \\
       2 & : p \le \alpha_L^2  \\
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{align} 

The three market possibilities as they depend upon the values of $\alpha_L$, $\alpha_H$ and $p$ are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:three_types}. 
The figure shows the space defined by $\alpha_H \in [0,1] \times \alpha_L \in [0,1]$ when $p = \frac{1}{2}$.
Since $\alpha_H > \alpha_L$ by definition, we only consider the space about the 45 degree line. 
The upper-right triangle labeled ``Both buy'' is the region where both consumer-types buy and the lower-left triangle where neither buy.  
This area is defined by $\alpha_L^2 > p$ and $\alpha_H^2 > p$. 
To show the geometry of the problem, the square of the valuation parameter is plotted in a faint dotted line; 
the associated minimal-but-still-purchasing valuation parameter is shown as $\underline{\alpha}_H$ and $\underline{\alpha}_L$ for the high- and low-types, respectively. 
The upper left rectangle shows the region where the high-types buy but the low-types do not, while the lower left triangle shows the region where neither buy. 
We are particularly interested in the rectangle where high-types buy but low-types do not, because in this region, the purchasing high-types have excess capacity ($\alpha_H < 1$) but the low-types still value usage of the good ($\alpha_L > 0$) despite their non-purchase. 
In this region, the immediate possibility of mutually beneficial trade exists.

\subsection{Short-run P2P rental market equilibrium} 
We now suppose that through some technological advance, it becomes possible for the high-types to costlessly rent their entire excess capacity to the low-types. 
As first, we will assume that no one can revise their purchase decisions in light of this advance. 
Call the resulting equilibrium the ``short-run.'' 
Before the possibility of rental, the high-types were simply consuming $\alpha_H$, giving $1-\alpha_H$ to rent out.
If they had purchased the good, the low-types would consume $\alpha_L$. 
However, with the new possibility of rental, each consumer's decision problem has changed. 
The new owner optimization problem is 
\begin{align}
\argmax_x \quad 2\alpha_H x - x^2 + \underbrace{(1-x)r}_{\mbox{{\tiny Rental income}}} - p,   
\end{align} 
whereas the renter optimization problem is 
\begin{align}
\argmax_x \quad 2 \alpha_L x - x^2 - \underbrace{xr}_{\mbox{{\tiny Rental cost}}}.  
\end{align} 
where $r$ is the taken-as-given rental rate. 
Both decision problems yield the same usage decision, 
\begin{align}
x^*(\alpha_i) = \alpha_i - r/2. 
\end{align} 
where $i$ indexes consumer type. 
Let $x_H = x^*(\alpha_H)$ and $x_L = x^*(\alpha_L)$. 
For the rental market to clear 
\begin{align} 
1 - x_H(r) = x_L(r).
\end{align}   
If the market clears, then the rental rate is
\begin{align} \label{eq:strr} 
r = \alpha_H + \alpha_L - 1.  
\end{align} 
Note that if $1-\alpha_H > \alpha_L$, then a negative rental rate would be market clearing. 
This condition arises when the owner's excess capacity even in the absence of a rental market, $1-\alpha_H$, exceeds the non-owner's demand, $1-\alpha_L$.
\important{In contrast, if all consumers were allocated the good and their cumulative usage, $\alpha_H + \alpha_L$, would exceed the capacity of the actual stock of purchased goods, then a positive rental rate is needed to clear the market.}
Figure~\ref{fig:market_clearing} illustrates market clearing with a positive rental rate and the glut condition. 
The rental market demand is simply $x_L(r)$, whereas supply is $1-x_H(r)$. 
The market-clearing quantity is the optimal consumption of the low-types, $\alpha_L - r/2$. 
We add a supply curve with a lower $\alpha_H$ value (which moves out the supply curve, in red) such that the offered supply at $r = 0$ exceeds demand, creating a glut.  
\important{It is also clear from the figure that if the valuation parameter of either type rises, short-run rental rates increase, as increases in valuation lower supply and increase demand.}

\subsection{Social Surplus in the P2P rental market short-run} 
With the introduction of the P2P rental market there are several welfare-impacting changes: 
high-type consumption goes down (from $x_H = \alpha_H$ to  $x_H = \alpha_H - r/2$) and low-type consumption goes up (from $x_L = 0$ to $x_L = \alpha_L - r/2$). 
Change in utility for the high-types from reduced consumption is 
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta v_H &=& \underbrace{\left[2 \alpha_H \left(\alpha_H - r/2) - \alpha_H^2 \right]}_{\mbox{New P2P consumption utility}} - 
                             \underbrace{\left[\alpha_H^2 \right]}_{\mbox{Old consumption utility}}   \notag \\
           &=& - \frac{r^2}{4}. 
\end{eqnarray} 
This is obviously negative, but it is compensated by the rental income (which is irrelevant from a social surplus perspective---we will consider the distribution of surplus later). 
For the low-types, the change in utility from increased consumption is
\begin{align}
\Delta v_L = \alpha_L^2 - \frac{r^2}{4}. 
\end{align} 
The total change in consumer surplus from the introduction of the P2P rental market is thus: 
\begin{align}
\Delta S &=& \Delta v_H + \Delta v_L \notag \\ 
         &=&  \alpha_L^2 - \frac{r^2}{2} \notag \\
         &=& \alpha_L^2 - \frac{1}{2} \left( \alpha_H + \alpha_L -1 \right)^2.
\end{align} 
Figure~\ref{fig:welfare} is a contour plot of change in social surplus from the emergence of the P2P rental market for the space of possible valuation parameters.
The figure shows what we might already intuit: higher values of $\alpha_L$ increase the gain in social surplus.
Indeed, $\partial \Delta S/\partial \alpha_L = 1 - \alpha_H + \alpha_L > 0$ since $\alpha_H < 1$ and $\alpha_L > 0$. 
\important{The more the non-owners value the good, the greater the increase in social surplus from the emergence of P2P rental markets.} 
The case of $\alpha_H$ is more complex. 
Recall that a positive rental rate only occurs when $\alpha_H + \alpha_L > 0$.
\important{As such, an increase in the valuation of the high-types reduces social surplus in non-glut P2P rental scenarios:   
\begin{align} 
\frac{\partial \Delta S}{\partial \alpha_H} =  1 - (\alpha_H + \alpha_L) < 0.
\end{align}} 
In Figure~\ref{fig:welfare} the line stretching from $(1,0)$ to $(1/2, 1/2)$ indicates the glut/non-glut boundary. 
For all points to the right of that line, a higher $\alpha_H$ valuation reduces social surplus.  
\important{As, such the greatest social surplus is ``unlocked'' by the emergence of the P2P rental market when both purchasers and non-purchasers have similar and high-valuations.} 
In terms of the figure, the highest obtainable social surplus values for a fixed $\alpha_H + \alpha_L$ run along the 45 degree line that indicates $\alpha_H = \alpha_L$. 

For simplicity, I have ignored income effects as a cause of the pattern of ownership. 
However, for goods where income effects are important in the consumer's ownership decision problem, the $\alpha_H > \alpha_L$ requirement would no longer hold and potentially larger gains in social surplus would be unlocked by the P2P rental market emergence.

\subsection{Distributional impacts of the P2P rental market} 
% For a renter, indirect utility under the short-run P2P rental equilibrium is
% \begin{eqnarray} 
% v_L(\alpha_L, r) &=& \frac{1}{4}\left(r - 2\alpha_L \right)^2  \notag \\
%                  &=& \frac{1}{4} \left[ (1-\alpha_H) + \alpha_L \right]^2
% \end{eqnarray} 
% which is always positive. 
% Note further that the renter's increase in utility from the P2P-rental market is proportional to the square of their own (hypothetical) consumption and the high-types \emph{non}-consumption in the absence of the rental market. 
% In other words, for renters, the most value is unlocked when they had high latent demand unmet demand for the good and when there was a great deal of ``wasted'' excess capacity from the high-types. 

% For the owner of a good, their pre-rental market indirect utility was $\alpha_H^2$. 
% The increase in utility from the emergence of the P2P rental market, $\Delta v_O = v_O(\alpha_H, r) - \alpha_H^2$ is  
% \begin{eqnarray} 
% \Delta v_H &=& \left( \frac{3}{4} (1-\alpha_H) + \frac{1}{4} \alpha_L \right) (-1 + \alpha_H + \alpha_L) \notag  \\
%                  &=& \left( \frac{3}{4} (1-\alpha_H) + \frac{1}{4} \alpha_L \right) r  \notag  \\
%                  &>& (1-\alpha_H)r 
% \end{eqnarray} 
% As we would expect, any increase in utility depends upon having a positive rental rate. 
% We also know that this is only the case if $1- \alpha_H < \alpha_L$ and so $\Delta v_O > (1-\alpha_H)r$. 
% In other words, the increase in utility for the owner is always greater than simply selling the $1-\alpha_H$ at $r$. 
% The economic intuition is that when there is an excess of demand, the owner can optimally economize their own consumption to increase their utility beyond just not adjusting own-consumption and selling the excess.  

% \begin{prop}
% An increase in $\alpha_L$ increases the owner's surplus from the emergence the P2P rental market. 
% \end{prop} 
% \begin{proof}
% Unsurprisingly, an increase in $\alpha_L$ simply increases demand for the owner's excess capacity and so the increase in utility is proportional to the owner's capacity, $1-\alpha_H$ and the latent demand from the low-type, $\alpha_L$.  
% \begin{align}
% \frac{\partial \Delta v_O}{\partial \alpha_L} = \frac{1}{2} \left[(1-\alpha_H) + \alpha_L \right] > 0.  
% \end{align} 
% \end{proof} 

% \begin{prop}
% An owner's utility is increasing in the $\alpha$ and increasing in the rental rate, $r$. 
% \end{prop}

% \begin{prop}
% Regardless of the rental rate, an owner has a higher utility with the existent of the P2P rental market assuming there is no change in the product market price for the good. 
% \end{prop}

\subsection{Long-run P2P rental equilibrium} 
In the long-run equilibrium, all parties can revise their ownership decisions. 
The utility from owning is 
\begin{align}
v^{OWN}_i = 2\alpha_i x_i - x_i^2 + (1-x_i)r_{LR} - p   
\end{align} 
whereas the utility from renting is 
\begin{align}
v^{RENT}_{i} = 2\alpha_i x_i - x_i^2 - x_i r_{LR}  
\end{align} 
where $r_{LR}$ is the market-clearing long-run rental rate. 
The first order condition in both choices is $2 \alpha_i - 2 x_i - r_{LR} = 0$ and so $x^* = \alpha_i - r_{LR}/2$. 
Computing the indirect utility for both decisions, we have
\begin{align} 
v^{OWN} = \alpha_i^2 - p + \frac{r_{LR}^2}{4} + (1 - \alpha_i) r_{LR} \quad  \mbox{and} \quad v^{RENT} = \frac{1}{4} (r_{LR}- 2\alpha )^2. 
\end{align} 
Setting $v^{OWN} = v^{RENT}$ to find the conditions under which a user would be indifferent between renting and owning, the $\alpha_i$ term drops out and we are left with 
\begin{align}
p = r_{LR}. 
\end{align}
 \important{In the long-run P2P rental equilibrium, the rental rate equals the product market purchase price and ownership does not depend on usage patterns or valuation.}  

For this new market to clear, we have to determine what fraction of consumers choose to own. 
Let $f$ be the fraction of consumers that purchase the good in equilibrium. 
As ownership does not depend on valuation, we assume that both consumer types are equally likely to own. 
For the market to clear, 
\begin{align}
\left[ (1-x_H(p)) + (1-x_L(p))\right]f = \left(x_H(p) + x_L(p) \right)(1- f) 
\end{align} 
which simplifies to 
\begin{align}
f = \frac{x_H(p) + x_L(p)}{2}.  
\end{align} 
\important{The fraction of consumers owning in the long-run is the average usage rate in the population.}  

\subsection{Do both types still use the good in the long-run P2P equilibrium?}
Pre-P2P rental market, $\alpha_L^2 < p$, since the low-types did not buy. 
A relatively low $\alpha_L$ was needed to create the P2P rental market in the short-run, as these non-owners created the demand. 
As long as their was any excess supply, i.e., $\alpha_H < 1$, then the low-types would get to use the good in equilibrium. 
However, in the long-run, the rental rate is equal to $p$ and if $\alpha_L < p/2$, the low-types will not use the good at all, as the first unit used (before the quadratic usage cost term matters) offers negative utility. 
The model suggests the possibility of a transitory short-run phase in which low-types get access that disappears once former-ownders become renters and bid up rental rates until low-types would get no usage utility at the market rental rate. 

\subsection{Long-run P2P rental market consumer surplus} 
If both high- and low-types participate in the long-run P2P equilibrium, social surplus is 
\begin{align} 
S_1 & = \frac{1}{4}(p - 2\alpha_H)^2 + \frac{1}{4}(p - 2\alpha_L)^2 \notag \\
    & = \alpha_H^2 + \alpha_L^2 - p(\alpha_H + \alpha_L) + \frac{p^2}{2} \notag \\ 
\end{align} 
whereas in the pre-P2P rental market it was 
\begin{align}
S_0 = \alpha_H^2 - p 
\end{align} 

\begin{align}
S_1 - S_0 = \alpha_L^2 + (1 - \alpha_L - \alpha_H)p + p^2/2.  
\end{align} 

\subsection{Product market demand in the long-run P2P rental market equilibrium} 
Most commentators considering the sharing economy have often implicitly assumed that ownership would be reduced under full sharing, the intuition being that there is some fixed amount of demand for some good and that when idle goods are pulled into the market, demand can be met with a smaller total number of goods. 
\important{This is not the case:  
ownership would increase if the product market price was below the rental rate.} 
Intuitively, when the short-run rental rate is creater than the purchase price, a consumer could buy the good at $p$ and rent out the entire capacity for $r$ and since $r > p$, earn a profit. 

To see this algebraically, first consider that in the long-run P2P equilibrium, the new product market demand curve, $D_1$, is
\begin{align}
D_1(p) &= 2f \notag \\  
     &= x_H(p) + x_L(p) \notag \\ 
     &= \alpha_H + \alpha_L - p.  
\end{align} 

In the pre-sharing product market, $D_0(p) = 1$ since all of the high-types purchased the good. 
Let $r_{SR}$ be the short-run rental rate, which we recall from Equation~\ref{TK} is just $\alpha_H + \alpha_L - 1$. 
If demand is higher after the long-run P2P equilibrium emerges, then  
\begin{align} 
D_{1}(p) & > D_{0}(p) \notag \\
\alpha_H + \alpha_L - p &> 1 \notag \\ 
\alpha_H + \alpha_L - 1 &> p \notag \\ 
r_{SR} &>  p. 
\end{align} 

\important{If the market-clearing short-run rental rate is above the purchase price, ownership will increase, otherwise decrease.}
Practically speaking, this is likely to occur in situations where there are high valuations from both consumer types (making demand high and supply tight) as well as relatively low purchase prices, which make ownership more attractive. 

\subsection{Product market price effects and welfare} 

Higher product market prices reduce consumer welfare. 
However, the reduction in consumer welfare is smaller in the long-run P2P rental equilibrium. 
Recall that in the pre-sharing market, high-type welare was simply $\alpha_H^2 - p$, and so $v'(p) = -1$. 


An increase in the product market price reduces owner welfare with and without the P2P rental market, but the reduction in welfare is smaller in magnitude in the P2P rental case than in the non-rental case (where the reduction is 1 for 1). 



This is partly due to our modeling convention of their being equal numbers of both types---if low-types were far more numerous, then the equivalent paradox condition could be more easily met: 
consider that there are far more people that take vacations than their are people considering owning a second home.

\subsection{Consumer welfare under changes in the product market price} 
If the conditions specified in Proposition~\ref{prop:paradox} are satisfied, then demand in the product market increases. 
This higher product market price could undo some of the welfare gains from P2P rentals. 
Let $p_0$ be the original purchase price and $p_1 = p_0 + \delta p$ be the new product market-clearing price. 
In the long-run equilibrium, this is also the rental rate. 
 

If the short-run rental rate is greater than the purchase price and ownership increases, pre-P2P owners could be made worse-off: if supply in the product market is sufficiently inelastic, then increase product market prices could offset owner gains from sharing, though TK these would partially be passed through in higher rental rates. 
\begin{equation}
\alpha_H^2 - p_0 > v(\alpha_H, r) - p_1 
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Changed product market demand curve} 
Previously, there were ``kinks'' in the product market demand curve at $\alpha_H^2$ and $\alpha_L^2$. 
In the long-run P2P rental equilibrium, product demand now varies continuously, with $D(p) = x_H(p) + x_L(p) = \alpha_H + \alpha_L - p$. 
Point elasticity of demand is now 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \frac{-1}{\alpha_H + \alpha_L - p} 
\end{equation} 

\subsection{Chicken and egg markets}
In the other two pre-P2P rental market configurations---no one buys and everyone buys---what happens? 

\subsection{P2P rental markets and the ``No one buys'' equilibrium} 
One the pre-P2P rental market configurations with two consumer types was an equilibrium in which no on bought the good: 
if $p > \alpha_H^2$, no consumer purchases the good. 
With P2P rental, does the lowest price at which some of the good is sold change? 
\important{It does: a P2P rental market in long-run equilibrium can support a higher product market price than pre-rental.}  
Intuitively, if a would-be owner can earn rental income from their unused portion, it seems likely that a higher product market price is supportable. 
If $p > \alpha_H^2$, no one buys the product and the market fails to exist.
The highest possible price that can support a market is $\bar{p}_0 = \alpha_H^2$.  
In the long-run P2P market, $D(p) = \alpha_H + \alpha_L - p$, and so $\bar{p}_{1} = \alpha_H + \alpha_L$. 
Since $\alpha_H > \alpha_H^2$ and $\alpha_L > 0$, $\bar{p}_1 > \bar{p}_0$.  

\subsection{Can for-profit capital-owning firms compete?} 
In the long-run P2P rental market equilibrium, there are no profits from owning to simply rent-out. 
However, owners and non-owners alike get a surplus. 
This suggests that firms that derive no consumption value from the good can not compete: 
because the consumer has excess capacity after satisfying their own consumption, they can ``profitably'' sell 
their excess capacity at any price and still have positive utility. 
A firm owning simply to rent would make zero profit. 

\subsection{Taste for diversity} 
In some formulations of the consumer problem, consumers consume some positive amount of every good offered.
For example, a Cobb-Douglas utility function has no corner solutions---every good is consumed at least a little bit.
This is obviously a large departure from empirical reality if we draw find-grained distinctions between ``goods.'' 
For example, Amazon.com currently lists 6,238 results for "blender" in the Home \& Kitchen category: 
presumably most households own far fewer than this, with most owning 1 or 0.
The reason for this pattern in the language of this model is clear: 
a consumer's $\alpha$ for Blender 2 \emph{conditional} upon owning Blender 1 is quite low and so another blender is not purchased.   
There are numerous goods that have highly negative cross price elasticities but that would not in a world of perfectly competitive rental markets in all goods.  
Very few people rent the same car they drive or vacation in their home towns. 
     
\section{Transaction costs and depreciation}

Note that in the short-run, $r$ did not depend directly on $p$, but in the long-run they are linked. 
Let $r_{SR}$ be the short-run rental rate and let $r_{LR}$ be the long-run rental rate. 
Let $p_{SR}$ and $p_{LR}$ be the short- and long-run product prices, respectively.  

If $r_{SR} > p_{SR} + \gamma$, there were excess profits available to being an owner. 
As such, in the long-run, demand in the product market will go up, raising $p_{LR}$ and lowering $r_{SR}$. 
In this case, the emergence of the sharing economy causes a Jevon's paradox of increased usage. 
Producer surplus rises, but the effect on consumers is ambiguous. 
Long-run non-sharers are made strictly worse-off, as they now face a higher price in the product market. 
All consumers that would not have purchased under the pre-sharing regime are better off, as they consumer some of the good.

TK---Prior owners now sharing have an ambiguous outcome---they consumer less and pay a higher purchase price but do receive offsetting rental income.  

On the contrary, if $r_{SR} < p_{SR} + \gamma$, ownership is less attractive and in the long-run, fewer goods will be purchased, lowering prices. 
In this case, the introduction of the sharing economy is Pareto improving with respect to consumers. 
Owners that do not rent out their good get a price reduction; former non-owners get to consume some of the good. 
For owners that rent out the good, they could consumer their old $x$ (pre-sharing) at a now-lower purchase price and so are strictly better off. 

Many goods have ``missing'' rental markets despite generating usage far below $x = 1$ because the rental rate $r$ required to cover the added transaction costs of renting would be too high to create a viable rental market. 

Suppose it costs the firm $\gamma$ to full rent-out an owned product and suppose rental goods have to be purchased in the product market. 
No arbitrage would mean that $p + \gamma = r$. 

\begin{prop}
Higher prices in the product market make the maximum transaction cost that would still permit a rental market to be lower. 
\end{prop} 

When opportunity costs are greater, people want to consumer less of each particular good, making renting relatively more attractive, meaning that a rental market can still exist with higher transaction costs. 

\subsection{What determines the fixed costs of renting?} 
Technology can reduce some of the fixed costs of renting. 
The thicker the market, the easier it is to fully make use of the excess supply. 
Goods with predictable or easily adjustable usage patterns are more likely to be P2P rental. 
Owners of vacation homes can schedule their own usage easily. 

Some goods are used infrequently, but all consumers will likely want to use them at the same time. 
A back-up generator---while infrequently used---is unlikely to make a
good P2P rental candidate, as demand spikes are likely to be correlated in both space and time. 

Reset costs presumably differ by good. 
Most things---apartments, cars, clothes etc., need to be cleaned and or serviced before they can be rented again. 
However, other goods like jewelry presumably have little reset cost.

Goods that have a high novelty value are particularly amenable to renting: 
This explains why rentals or lending of videos and books are/were commonplace.  

Goods that are difficult to transport but need to be used in a different locations will be hard to share. 
However, goods that can be used on-site by different people are more shareable. 
For example, yachts are relatively difficult to transport long distances, but there is a thriving P2P rental market in boats where many want to sail on vacation: 
in the British Virgin islands charter yachts are owned by individuals. 

If transaction costs are sufficiently high, then the rental rate would be too high to support a market (even though the high rental rate would tend to stimulate supply). 

\section{Empirical investigation} 

In conventional consumer theory, preferences over goods are assumed---the theory focuses on how those preferences are translated into purchases in light of the consumer's budget and market prices. 

\subsection{What makes a good ``rentable''?} 
The general characteristic of goods that are ``rentable'' are those that are used infrequently but are expensive: 
cars and hotels in distant cities, tuxedos, certain kinds of specialty tools (e.g., rototillers, carpet shampoers) and so on. 
However, these goods were usually offered by a company who owned the stock with the explicit purpose of renting.  
And although these goods are owned by at least some consumers who would have excess capacity, the transaction costs of facilitating peer-to-peer rentals would be prohibitive. 
Simply finding an appropriate trading partner would be difficult, to say nothing of coming to terms, writing a contract, monitoring compliance, handling disputes, making payment and so on. 
Further, those individuals that owned a good despite the existence of a rental market were likely those with relatively little excess capacity to rent out. 

Goods with high purchase prices but low and predictable intensive margin usage are ideal for P2P rental markets: 
the purchase price is high enough that there are lots of would-be consumers with high willingness to pay and enough owners with excess capacity that the market-clearing rental rate is not prohibitively high. 
When produce market prices are low, there is no excess demand so nearly everyone buys the product, so even if the good is used infrequently, no rental market can exist.  
For example, there is no rental market in egg timers---although they are used infrequently and quite durable, there is neither supply (no one owning finds it worth the trouble to rent them out) nor demand (if one wants one, they go to the product market). 
Other goods are expensive but there is no excess capacity, as they are used more or less continuously. 
For example, there is and can be no P2P rental market in dentures. 
Other goods are used infrequently and are expensive but make poor sharing candidates because demand is so unpredictable. 
For example, a back-up gas-powered electrical generator is used infrequently but would be difficult to rent in a P2P market, as demand is likely to be correlated in space and time.

Table~\ref{tab:ownership} shows that TK. 

\input{./tables/ownership.tex}

Table~\ref{tab:ownership_attr} explores how the perceived usage attributes of the good are related to the ownership decision.
My hypothesis was that goods with an unpredictable usage pattern and/or whose usage was spread out over many small chunks would necessitate ownership. 
In Column~(1), we see that the less predictable perceived usage, the more likely the good is to be owned. 
In Column~(2), the more granular usage is, the more likely the good it to be owned. 

\input{./tables/ownership_attr.tex} 

In this model presented in this paper, preferences are still primitives of the model, but they are modeled as differences in planned \emph{usage} of the good.  

\cite{kuziemko2013elastic} 

I asked a sample of respondents on Mechanical Turk various questions about a particular good: 
\begin{itemize} 
\item Does your household own a $\{$ good $\}$? (yes, no) 
\item Have you ever lent your $\{$ good $\}$ to someone else? (yes, no, n/a)
\item Have you ever rented a $\{$ good $\}$? (yes, no, n/a)
\end{itemize}  

Does planned low-usage predict non-ownership? 
If demand is not predictable, is it difficult to borrow the good? 
If a good is not owned but amenable to sharing, it is more likely to be rented? 
Do income effects matter?

\section{Conclusion}
In the very long-run, product differentiation could move towards making sharing more attractive. 
Individuals will purchase more durable goods to reduce the frequency of replacement. 
Goods with broad appeal will see an increase in demand compared to more idiosyncratic goods that cater to the owner's taste (similar to how re-sale value enters into some consumers decisions now). 
There will be a shift towards products that are more easily shareable. 
For example, locks on cars and houses that allow remote entry will be more appealing. 

On-going technological developments should reduce the costs of sharing. 
The Internet-of-Things will make it easier to identify goods that are not being used at a moment in time. 
It will also permit more instrumentation which in turn should facilitate contracting. 
For example, many goods might make a high resolution video, with precise time-tracked location of how they are being used, reducing concerns about moral hazard. 
As more of economic and social life are computer-mediated, platforms will use this information to verify the identify and reputation of buyers and sellers, mitigating moral hazard and adverse selection.  

Product market producers will subsidize sharing of experience goods, say by offering them at a discount to known-sharers.\footnote{GM is already doing this with RelayRides}.  

For goods for which Jevon's paradox does not hold, marketing will be re-directed towards encouraging ownership.
Barring that, advertisers will trumpet the rental stream income from a purchase and highlight the advantages of residual control rights. 
We might see more B2B rentals, particular among companies that have similar inputs but are not competitors in the product market. 
Goods with declining real prices are unattractive for sharing businesses, as the trend will be towards ownership. 

Digital goods are incredibly attractive for P2P ``rental'' but since a single owner can meet all the demand among non-owners, the rental rate is zero.
The reason is that even if the owner uses $x$, $1$ is still available to the person ``rented'' to.  
Of course, this is just piracy.

%Some goods are easy to make a consumption plan for---rental homes, high-end camera equipment. 
% While it makes sense to think of consumers making an extensive margin decision---buy or not buy---their individual decision, at least for some goods, is based on a solution to another optimization problem. 
% When considering a purchase, individuals are deciding ``how much am I going to use this?'' 
% This decision has to be made for nearly every consequential purchase. 
% Once a durable good is purchased, the cost of using---less depreciation---is the opportunity cost of doing something else. 
% Once purchased, a good is used up until the point that its declining marginal utility equals only the opportunity cost. 
% This is a different decision than one makes if using a rental, where the marginal cost is both the opportunity cost and the rental rate.

% When the capital costs are very high but usage by owners is relatively low, it is more likely that there are large numbers of would-be consumers and the excess capacity to satisfy them.  
% Goods being offered my a monopolist are likely to be below the  
% Most people spent only about two minutes a day brushing their teeth, giving them 4,598 minutes they could rent out their toothbrush.  
% But reset costs are likely to be high, people want to brush around the same times each day and the price of a toothbrush is so low that anyone who brushes their teeth finds it more convenient to own. 

% % Idea: time use survey 
% Owning a good and renting it out generates costs. 
% Some of these are recognizable transaction costs, such as finding a renter and coming to terms. 
% There is also the cost of writing contracts and monitoring compliance, purchasing insurance, dealing with moral hazard and adverse selection.\footnote{High-end car company had its entire fleet of fancy cars stolen.} 

% The main effect of IT when paired with for-profit platforms are reductions in the costs of renting. 
% The platforms aggregate demand and expose where supply resides, reducing search costs. 
% They have standardize contracts. 
% They measure usage and handle payments. 
% They invest in tools to reduce information asymmetries and moral hazard. 

% % How much time was spent with a good  
% % How much that good or service costs

% What IT enables: 
% - aggregate demand 
% - expose where the supply resides 
% - overcome informational problems (information asymmetries and moral
% hazard) 
% - payment timing issues (the escrow problem) 
% - Adding complexity of moral hazard. 

% Similar to P2P electronic commerce in many respects.  Uber and Airbnb are the most prominent examples. 
% The sharing economy raises several economic questions whose answer is not intuitively obvious. 
% On the one hand, if individuals can rent infrequently used property to each other, then it seems plausible that fewer of those things are actually needed. 
% For example, it is easy to imagine one suburban neighborhood sharing a single drill, whereas before, multiple households would have purchased one. 
% Of course, rental markets are not new. 
 % On the other hand, when individuals can share durable goods among themselves the greater intensity of use may actually increase demand: 
% this ``rebound effect'' or Jevons paradox seems possible. 
% Another question is who participates in the sharing economy: 
% heavy users of some durable good are likely to purchase rather than rent, but they are also unlikely to rent the item out as they are unlikely to have much spare capacity to rent. 
% Light users do have more capacity, but they are potentially the ones that get the least utility from the good anyway.
